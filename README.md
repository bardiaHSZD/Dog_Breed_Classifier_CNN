# Dog_Breed_Classifier_CNN
A convolution neural network algorithm to identify dog breeds from a data-set of breed classifications. Feel free to submit a human photo, the algorithm will find out which dog breed resembles your photo. Thecode is implemented in python and uses PyTorch VGG-16 for classification of dog breeds. It also demonstrates how to create the VGG-16 network from scratch using PyTorch.
